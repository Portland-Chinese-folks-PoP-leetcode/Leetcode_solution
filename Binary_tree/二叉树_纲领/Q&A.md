## How many inplementation of List do java have?

In the Java Collections Framework, there are several commonly used implementations of the List interface. Here are three main implementations:

ArrayList: This is a resizable array that automatically grows and shrinks as needed. It is backed by an array, which makes it suitable for situations where you need fast random access to elements. However, the insertion or deletion of elements at arbitrary positions can be slow, as it might require shifting other elements.

LinkedList: This is a doubly-linked list, where each element points to the previous and next elements in the list. It is more efficient than ArrayList for inserting or deleting elements at arbitrary positions. However, random access to elements is slower compared to ArrayList because it requires traversing the list.

Vector: This is similar to ArrayList, but it is synchronized, making it suitable for multi-threaded environments. However, its performance may be slower than ArrayList due to the overhead of synchronization. In modern Java applications, it's generally better to use ArrayList along with explicit synchronization or concurrent data structures when needed, rather than using Vector.

There are other less common implementations of List as well, such as CopyOnWriteArrayList, which is a thread-safe variant of ArrayList optimized for scenarios where reads are much more frequent than writes. However, the three implementations mentioned above are the most commonly used.
